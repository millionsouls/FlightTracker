A Raspberry Pi-powered RGB LED matrix that shows you what aircraft are overhead. It sits on your fridge, or a shelf, or wherever you decide to put it, and quietly answers the important question: **"What's that plane?"**

FlightTracker takes live aircraft data, works out what is nearby, and displays it on a 64x32 RGB LED matrix. When there's nothing overhead, it shows the time, weather, temperature, rainfall, or satellite passes.

## v1 to v2

Recently (June 2026) this codebase has had a major rewrite. There are detailed guides on the update procedure but it's worth pointing out the change in branching:

 - `main` is the new home for FlightTracker `v2`
 - `master` is the resting place of FlightTracker `v1`

## FlightTracker OS

FlightTracker OS is available as a 32 bit or 64 bit Raspberry Pi image with a browser-based installer for setting up your Flight Tracker.

[Find out more about FlightTracker OS →](https://flight-tracker.dev/os/)

## Installation

### Quick install

Run this over SSH on a fresh Raspberry Pi OS (Lite) install and the script will detect your Pi model and run the appropriate installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://flight-tracker.dev/install.sh | bash
```

The installer detects your hardware, clones the repo, sets up the Python environment, and configures a systemd service so FlightTracker starts on boot.

### Step-by-step install

If you'd rather do it manually - or you want to understand what the script does - follow the guide for your platform:

| Platform | Guide |
|----------|-------|
| Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 / Zero | [platforms/pi/INSTALL.md](platforms/pi/INSTALL.md) |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | [platforms/pi5/INSTALL.md](platforms/pi5/INSTALL.md) |
| Desktop simulator | [platforms/simulator/INSTALL.md](platforms/simulator/INSTALL.md) |

## 3D Printed Case

There's an official 3D-printable case for FlightTracker, designed for the 64×32 HUB75 RGB LED matrix (4mm pitch). It's a two-piece interlocking design that works with any Raspberry Pi model and prints on a normal-sized bed with minimal supports.

## Optional features

### Loading LED

An LED wired to a GPIO pin can blink while flight data is loading. Enable it in the web UI under Hardware settings, and set the GPIO pin number to match your wiring.

### Rainfall chart

If you have a WeatherAPI key configured, you can display a 24-hour rainfall chart alongside the temperature. Set the weather mode to "temperature + rainfall" in the web UI.

### Using a local ADS-B receiver (tar1090)

By default the tracker pulls flight data from FlightRadar24. If you run your own ADS-B receiver with [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090) or a compatible [PiAware](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/) / [dump1090-fa](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) setup, you can use that as your primary data source instead - no FlightRadar24 account or API access required.

#### What you need

- A device running dump1090-fa, readsb, or similar, with tar1090 installed
- The device must be reachable on your local network from the Flight Tracker Pi
- tar1090-db enrichment active (the default in most installations) - it provides the aircraft type descriptions used by this software

#### Finding your aircraft.json URL

Try each of the following in your browser, replacing `your-receiver` with your device's hostname or IP address, until you get a response containing a list of aircraft:

```
http://your-receiver/tar1090/data/aircraft.json
http://your-receiver:8080/data/aircraft.json
http://your-receiver/dump1090-fa/data/aircraft.json
http://your-receiver/skyaware/data/aircraft.json
```

The response should be a JSON object with an `"aircraft"` array.

#### Enabling tar1090 as your data source

Once you have the URL, open the web UI and go to **Providers** → **Provider Settings** → **tar1090**, enter the URL, then enable tar1090 (and order it ahead of FlightRadar24 if you want the local receiver to win) under **Providers** → **Lookup Priority**.

#### Differences from FlightRadar24 mode

- Aircraft type (e.g. "Airbus A-320") is sourced directly from the tar1090 aircraft database
- Origin and destination airport codes are looked up via [adsbdb.com](https://api.adsbdb.com)
- All position and altitude data comes from your receiver in real time
- No rate limiting or API key required

### Using OpenSky Network as your data source

[OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org) is a free, community-driven ADS-B network that can be used instead of (or ahead of) FlightRadar24 as the flight data source. No subscription is required - a free registered account gives you enough API credits for 30-second polling.

#### What you need

- A free account at [opensky-network.org](https://opensky-network.org)
- An API client created under Account -> API Clients (gives you a Client ID and Client Secret)

#### Enabling OpenSky Network

1. Log in to the FlightTracker web interface
2. Go to **Providers** → **Provider Settings** → **OpenSky Network** and enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Enable OpenSky (and order it ahead of FlightRadar24) under **Providers** → **Lookup Priority**
4. Save - the tracker will restart and begin fetching from OpenSky

#### Differences from FlightRadar24 mode

- Uses OAuth2 credentials (Client ID + Client Secret) rather than a third-party library
- Aircraft type and route origin/destination are both looked up via [adsbdb.com](https://api.adsbdb.com), the same service used in tar1090 mode
- If your credentials are invalid the provider is quarantined for an hour and the tracker falls back to any other enabled flight provider
- Data refreshes every 30 seconds

## Satellite Tracking

To see when a particular satellite is over head enter its [NORAD ID](https://celestrak.org/SATCAT/search.php) in the device config and it'll let you know where to look, its altitude and speed. In the web settings under **Sky Monitoring → Satellite Tracking**, choose either CelesTrak or N2YO for TLE updates. CelesTrak is the default; N2YO requires an API key, which is stored as a secret and masked in the settings and debug-config export. The selected source is used when cached TLEs expire (every three days); changing sources does not force an extra request.

## Running the tracker from the command line

The main entrypoint is the script at the repo root:

```bash
cd /home/pi/FlightTracker
source env/bin/activate
python3 flight-tracker.py help
```

The CLI supports a small set of commands for configuration and maintenance:

```text
Usage: python flight-tracker.py [command]
Commands:
  config                 Dump current configuration as JSON
  data                   Print the platform data directory path
  reset password         Clear web_password_hash in the config
  reset settings         Delete the config.json file
  cache clear            Wipe all on-disk cache files (routes and TLE)
  interface enable       Enable the web interface in the config
  interface disable      Disable the web interface in the config
  test flights           Test the flight provider chain (JSON output)
  test flights --provider tar1090
                         Test a single provider
  test tle               Test TLE satellite lookup
  help                   Show this help message
  --version              Print the program version
```

Test commands accept `--parameters` and `--interval`/`--limit` for repeated runs. Run `python flight-tracker.py test <target> --help` for details.

For normal operation, start the tracker with `python3 flight-tracker.py` and use the configuration file or the web settings UI to control its behaviour.

## Updating to the most recent version

If your checkout is still on the old `master` branch, switch to `main` before pulling updates:

```bash
cd /home/pi/FlightTracker
git fetch --all
git checkout main
git pull
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r platforms/pi/requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart FlightTracker.service
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **The installation went well, you selected Convenience Mode (no soldering) and can't see anything:**
   Head into the settings interface and go into the `Hardware` section and select Convenience Mode
   for a second time, then hit save.

- **Only the top half of the screen is lit up:**
  Check the panel you've bought to see if it says `32S` (1:32 scan rate) anywhere on it. These aren't supported by this code
  yet but it should be an easy fix - [more details here](https://github.com/ColinWaddell/FlightTracker/issues/73). If you get it working
  let me know in the ticket as I want to add this to the settings page.

- **Everything looks red**:
  Your power supply isn't supplying enough power to the screen.

- **I changed a setting now the deice wont start:**
  Reset your settings by deleting your config and rebooting

```bash
# Before v2.3.0
rm ~/.local/share/FlightTracker/config.json
sudo reboot

# After v2.3.0
cd ~/FlightTracker
source env/bin/active
python flight-tracker.py reset settings
```

- **Everything is broken and it wont boot:**
  [Raise a ticket](https://github.com/ColinWaddell/FlightTracker/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) and tell me what you can see. The most useful info comes from trying to run it manually like this:

```bash
# Disable the service
sudo systemctl stop FlightTracker.service

# Get ready to run the code
cd ~/FlightTracker
source env/bin/activate

# Copy the output of this into a ticket
python flight-tracker.py

# Include this in the ticket
# Please remove any confidential information before posting (specifically: API keys)
python flight-tracker.py config

# If you want to resart the service
sudo systemctl start FlightTracker.service
```

- **Only half my screen is lit up:**
  Head into `Setting -> Hardware` and select `1:32` as your scan-rate.
