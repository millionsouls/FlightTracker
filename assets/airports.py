    """Build derived airport tables from world-airports.csv rows.

    Returns ``(airports, full, ica0, iata0)``:

    ``airports``
        IATA-keyed entries - the historic bundled behaviour.

    ``full``
        A copy of ``airports`` extended with FAA/local-code keys for
        rows without an IATA code, plus the row's ICAO/gps code when
        the airport has no IATA code.  Route services answer with
        ICAO-style codes for such airports (KRGA), and without the key
        the code survives the ICAO->IATA fallback as a bare code with
        no name.  A row's ``icao_code`` is preferred over its
        ``gps_code`` (the ICAO column is sparse, but authoritative
        when present).  Codes longer than four characters are
        excluded: ICAO and FAA local codes are four at most (0I8,
        98KY), and the longer values in the CSV are administrative
        numbering (mostly Brazil) that route services never send as a
        display code.  IATA always wins a colliding key - some
        countries' local codes coincide with real IATA codes (a local
        "MAN", "PVG", ...) and must not shadow them.  Closed airports
        are skipped, and repeated codes are settled by the CSV's
        ``score`` column.

    ``ica0``
        ICAO -> IATA mapping for rows that have both codes.

    ``iata0``
        The reverse: IATA -> ICAO for the same rows.  Powers the
        optional ICAO journey-code display, which converts the IATA
        codes route services emit into their 4-letter ICAO form.
