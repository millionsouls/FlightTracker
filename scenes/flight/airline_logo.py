"""Airline logo widget - draws an 18x18 airline icon at (0, 0).

The icon is sourced from the operating carrier's ICAO code, resolved by
:func:`airline_icao_from_flight` from three sources in descending order of
confidence: ``flight.airline_icao`` (the flight's carrier, from a route
provider), ``flight.operator_icao`` (the airframe's registered operator,
from its Mode S hex address), and finally the first 3 alphabetic
characters of ``flight.icao_callsign``.  The two inferred sources are
corrected via ``_BRAND_OVERRIDES`` for franchise/wet-lease arrangements
and validated against a non-airline blocklist that rejects military,
government, and other non-commercial operators whose 3-letter ICAO
designators might otherwise match a logo file.  The resulting code is the
PNG filename - e.g. ``BAW`` -> ``assets/airlines/BAW.png``.  When no code
resolves or the PNG is missing, a black square with a white outline is
drawn as a placeholder.

The widget is draw-once: it caches the last prefix rendered and skips
repainting while the prefix is unchanged (the icon is static per flight).
``reset()`` clears the cache so the next ``draw()`` always repaints -
used on flight change, route change, and scene re-entry to avoid leaving
a stale icon behind.

# S hex operator code, which is unique to the aircraft; adding them here

# real airline designator (``GBSFE`` -> ``GBS`` -> "Global Air Services
# Nigeria"), so the prefix fallback must only run on callsigns that actually
# look like airline flights.

    Three sources are tried in descending order of confidence.

    1. ``flight.airline_icao`` - the operating carrier reported by a route
       provider (adsbdb, AeroDataBox, FR24) for *this flight*.  Trusted
       as-is and returned directly, even when the code has no IATA mapping
       (e.g. cargo carriers or shuttle services) and even when it is a
       non-commercial operator: the blocklist below only guards the
       inferred paths.

    2. ``flight.operator_icao`` - the registered operator of *this
       airframe*, resolved from its Mode S hex address (see
       ``route_lookup._lookup_aircraft``).  This is the only per-aircraft
       signal available, so it is what resolves ICAO designator
       collisions: two operators sharing a 3-letter code still have
       distinct hex addresses.  Brand overrides and the non-airline
       blocklist both apply.  An operator code that matches no known
       airline name falls through to the callsign prefix rather than
       resolving to a logo that does not exist.

    3. The 3-letter designator of ``flight.icao_callsign``, but only when
       the callsign has the ICAO flight-identification shape of 3 letters
       followed by a digit (e.g. ``UAL1583`` -> ``UAL``).  A callsign that
       is a bare aircraft registration (``GBSFE``, ``DAIZY``) is rejected
       outright: a general-aviation aircraft has no airline, and slicing
       its first 3 characters would invent one.  Weakest signal even so -
       a callsign designator is not guaranteed to be the operator's ICAO
       code - so brand overrides and the blocklist apply here too.
       Commercial airlines without IATA codes (e.g. ``SHT`` = British
       Airways Shuttle) pass through correctly.

    Returns ``""`` if no path yields a usable code, so the placeholder
    outline is drawn instead.
