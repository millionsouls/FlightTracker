"""FlightRadar24 route lookup via the live feed (position bubble + callsign).

The FR24 real-time feed list includes origin/destination IATA codes and the
airline ICAO code for free, so a single ``get_flights`` call inside a bubble
around the aircraft's live position is enough to resolve routing for
aircraft that other providers missed.  The bubble is sized by the
aircraft's ground speed to allow for feed staleness, and the match is
identified by callsign (the disambiguator within the bubble).

Lookups require a live position; without one the provider answers
``NOT_FOUND`` rather than pretending to have no data.
