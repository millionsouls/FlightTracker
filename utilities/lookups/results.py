"""
Provider-independent lookup result types and data models.

This module is the shared vocabulary of the lookup architecture:

* :class:`LookupStatus` / :class:`LookupResult` - explicit outcome types used
  by every provider and understood by the caching / fallback / quarantine
  layers.  A provider that cannot currently answer (timeout, rate limit,
  network failure, malformed response) reports ``UNAVAILABLE``; a provider
  that answered but has no data reports ``NOT_FOUND``.  The distinction
  drives negative caching and quarantine behaviour.

* :class:`RouteInfo` / :class:`AircraftInfo` - provider-independent enrichment
  metadata.  Providers translate their service responses into these;

* :class:`FlightObservation` - a live flight position produced by a flight
  provider.  Observations are live data and are never cached.

* :class:`LookupContext` - per-aircraft context passed to enrichment
  providers (callsign, mode-s hex, live position) so that providers that
  need a live-position hint (e.g. FlightRadar24's bounds lookup) can use it.

Provider interfaces (duck-typed, implemented by ``lookups.providers.*``):

    FlightProvider.fetch(query)    -> LookupResult[list[FlightObservation]]
    RouteProvider.lookup_route(cx) -> LookupResult[RouteInfo]
    AircraftProvider.lookup_ac(ctx)-> LookupResult[AircraftInfo]
