"""
Route lookup service.

Resolves origin/destination (and flight-level airline identity) for a
callsign by walking the user's configured route-provider priority list,
backed by the persistent callsign cache:

1.  Persistent cache (``routes_cache.json``): miss entries (1 h) skip the
    provider chain entirely; positive entries seed the pipeline result.
2.  Provider pipeline: each *enabled, configured, non-quarantined* provider
    fills what it can.  Higher-priority results are never overwritten -
    lower-priority providers only fill blanks (``RouteInfo.merge_missing``)
    - and the pipeline stops as soon as the *flight-level* result is
    complete (origin, destination, airline).  Airframe identity (type,
    registration, operator) is deliberately not chased here: the mode-s
    aircraft pipeline owns it and caches it per airframe, so route
    providers are never re-queried just to fill airframe fields.  An
    ``UNAVAILABLE`` result quarantines the provider temporarily and is
    never cached as a miss.
3.  Gap-fill back-off: a cached route that is still incomplete (e.g. a GA
    flight with no airline anywhere) re-asks the chain at most once an
    hour instead of on every poll, so a paid provider low in the priority
    list is called once per flight, not once per poll.
4.  Stale fallback: a recently-expired positive entry (within 7 days) is
    re-cached with its timestamp advanced 4 h and returned, so the display
    keeps showing real route data while providers are failing.
5.  Miss caching: when every provider answers ``NOT_FOUND``, the callsign
    is miss-cached for 1 h so repeated polls skip the HTTP calls.
